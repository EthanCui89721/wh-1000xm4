Ethan Cui: Design and Develop a Digital Media Outcome

# This is my WH-1000XM4 Project

### About my project
   We wanted to make a website about the Sony WH-1000XM4 because it can help people looking for a pair of headphones. My partner and I, who were working on the website, are both owners of this pair of wireless, noise cancelling headphones. So it is better that we can also give an owner's experience of this spectacular pair of headphones.

### The Desgin
* Colour
  * I've used colours of the range of Sony headphones
  * The web app that I used to analyse the colours of the photographs in my site is [colorexploer.com]
* Layout
  * The reason for using this layout of the home page: We chose this layout because it looked clean and neat. 
* Font Styles
* Media
