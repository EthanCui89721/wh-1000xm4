# This is my WH-1000XM4 Project

### About my project
   We wanted to make a website about the Sony WH-1000XM4 because it can help people looking for a pair of headphones. My partner and I, who were working on the website, are both owners of this pair of wireless, noise cancelling headphones. So it is better that we can also give an owner's experience of this spectacular pair of headphones.
